# Exploring the NOAA Storm Database

## Introduction

This project explores the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) storm database, which provides detailed information about significant storms and weather events across the United States. The database tracks the location, timing, and impact of these events in terms of fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The main goals of this analysis are:
1. To identify which types of events are most harmful to population health.
2. To determine which types of events have the greatest economic consequences.

## Data Processing

The data was processed to clean up and convert relevant columns, including the property and crop damage values. The damage values were converted into their numeric forms to allow for proper aggregation and analysis.

## Analysis

### 1. Health Impact Analysis

The data was analyzed to identify the top events in terms of injuries and fatalities. The top 5 weather events with the most significant public health impact were visualized using bar charts.

### 2. Economic Damage Analysis

Property and crop damage were aggregated to determine the most economically damaging weather events. Events such as floods, hurricanes, and droughts were identified as causing the most financial losses.

## Results

### Health Impact

- Tornadoes were found to have the greatest public health impact, causing the highest number of both fatalities and injuries.

### Economic Damage

- Floods caused the most property damage, while droughts had the largest impact on crop damage.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides key insights into the types of weather events that pose the greatest risks to public health and economic resources. Such information can help guide policy and preparedness efforts to mitigate the impact of severe weather events.
